# Apple Mail TOC Wrapper

This repository contains a small Objective-C Parser Class
for the table_of_contents files found in Apple Mail mailboxes
exports. This was written just for fun, it is mainly for the
curious, although it could be useful for reading huge mailboxes.



Usage :

```
pod 'FMDB'
# pod 'FMDB/FTS'   # FMDB with FTS
# pod 'FMDB/standalone'   # FMDB with latest SQLite amalgamation source
# pod 'FMDB/standalone/FTS'   # FMDB with latest SQLite amalgamation source and FTS
# pod 'FMDB/SQLCipher'   # FMDB with SQLCipher
```
