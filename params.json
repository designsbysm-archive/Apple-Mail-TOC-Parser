This was written just for fun, it is mainly for the\r\ncurious, although it could be useful for handling huge mailboxes.\r\nAn example App Xcode target is included in the project.\r\n\r\nUsage :\r\n\r\nAdd AppleMailOCParser.h and AppleMailOCParser.m from the Parser Class\r\nfolder to your project. Initialize a parser object with the path of\r\nthe table_of_contents file, then the implementation is quite straightforward.\r\nIt returns an array of dictionaries each representing an object.\r\n\r\nThe Dictionary Keys are :\r\n\r\n```\r\nsenderAddress\r\nemailNumber\r\nemailOffset\r\nemailLength\r\n```\r\n\r\nExample\r\n\r\n```\r\nAppleMailOCParser *tocParser = [[AppleMailTOCParser alloc] initWithPath:pathToTable_of_Contents];\r\n\r\nNSArray *emailDictionaries = [tocparser parse];\r\n```","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
